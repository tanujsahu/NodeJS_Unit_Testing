# NodeJS_Unit_Testing
Jest is a powerful and flexible testing framework for Node.js that makes it easy to write and run unit tests for your code. By following the examples and tips provided in this article, you should be well on your way to writing effective Jest tests for your own Node.js projects.

Getting Started with Jest
To get started with Jest, you'll first need to install it as a dependency in your Node.js project. You can do this using npm by running the following 

## command:
    npm install --save-dev jest

Once you've installed Jest, you can create a test file for your code. Jest looks for test files with the .test.js or .spec.js extension, so you'll want to create a file with one of those extensions in the same directory as the code you're testing.

Writing Your First Jest Test
To create a Jest test, you'll use the test function provided by Jest. This function takes two arguments: a description of the test and a callback function that contains the test code. Here's an example:

## javascript:
      test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
        expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
      });

In this example, we're testing that adding 1 and 2 results in 3. The expect function is used to make assertions about the test code. In this case, we're using the toBe matcher to assert that the result of the addition is exactly equal to 3.

# Running Your Jest Tests
To run your Jest tests, you can use the jest command in your terminal. By default, Jest will look for all files in your project that match the .test.js or .spec.js pattern, and run all of the tests in those files.

If you only want to run a specific test file, you can pass the file name to Jest as an argument:


jest my-test-file.test.js
Jest also provides a number of command line options for customizing the test run, such as running tests in watch mode, running tests in parallel, and filtering tests by name.
